# Implementation of A [CVPR_PAPER](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/research/papers/ibrahim-cvpr16.pdf) ,Name :A Hierarchical Deep Temporal Model for Group Activity Recognition

### Real Data (62gb) are on Kaggle and Check MY [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hossamasrw/volleyball-b1-phase) ^_^
### i don't work on notebooks but for my limiting resources i utilize the 30h free gpu use
#### videos_sample is just for POC (proof of concept) 


## Original Dataset

### Tracking and grouping

Grouping is a set of people involved in a primary group activity.
The players involved in each group acitivity are defined as follows:
[Pass]: Players who are trying an underhand pass independently of whether or not they are successful.
[Set]: Player who is doing an overhand pass and those who are going to spike the ball whether they are really trying or faking.
[Spike]: Players who are spiking and blocking. 
[Winpoint]: All players in the team that scores a point. This group activity is observed for a few seconds right after the score.

### Annotated data

We annotated 4830 sequences that are consisted of 55 videos as follows:
- We annotated the bounding-boxes of all players from 11 to 30 frames (10 images before a target frame, the target frame, and 9 frames after the target frame).
- Each video directory has a text file that contains framewise annotations
- Each annotation line consists of the following components: {player ID} {xmin} {ymin} {xmax} {ymax} {frame ID} {lost} {grouping} {generated} {individual action label}
- player ID
- xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax: The bounding box of this player.
- frame ID
- lost: If 1, the annotated bounding box is outside of the field of view.
- grouping: If 1, this player is involved in a primary group activity.
- generated: If 1, the bounding box was automatically interpolated.
- individual action label: The individual action label of each player, which was given in the original annotation of the Volley ball dataset.
